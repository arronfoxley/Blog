To get you thinking along the right lines&nbsp;and help put pen to paper, follow our top tips:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Ask lots of questions</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p>Generating content that successfully satisfies what your customers want to know requires a lot of research. Get into the habit of asking open-ended questions that answer the Who, What, Where, When, Why and How. Using this approach will allow you to delve deep and gain an understanding of what your website should&nbsp;include&nbsp;to&nbsp;build a considered site map.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Consider your Information Architecture&nbsp;(IA)</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p>How your&nbsp;content is organised and divided across the website is a crucial aspect of UX design.&nbsp;Without effective sorting, most users would be completely lost when navigating&nbsp;a&nbsp;site&nbsp;and there’s no point having&nbsp;memorable features if they can’t be found!&nbsp;Use card sorting exercises, tree tests, user journey mapping&nbsp;and user flow diagrams to&nbsp;form&nbsp;an understanding of how&nbsp;best&nbsp;to display your content in a logical and accessible way.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Conduct&nbsp;qualitative and&nbsp;quantitative&nbsp;research</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p>Although Google Analytics is extremely useful, it doesn’t hold all the answers.&nbsp;Google&nbsp;Analytics is great at telling you&nbsp;<em>what</em>&nbsp;your users are doing, but it doesn’t give you&nbsp;the&nbsp;insight into&nbsp;<em>why</em>&nbsp;they’re doing it. Qualitative one-to-one user interviews is an effective method of really getting to grips with&nbsp;your user needs&nbsp;to&nbsp;understand&nbsp;why they do what they do.&nbsp;User&nbsp;testing also falls into this category.&nbsp;Seeing a user navigate through your website on a mobile phone&nbsp;in day to day life&nbsp;can give you great insight&nbsp;for&nbsp;UX design&nbsp;in terms of&nbsp;context and situation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Align your content strategy with long-term business goals</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p>Before beginning your web project,&nbsp;it’s important to understand the goals of the project and the pain points you are trying to solve.&nbsp;Include all the necessary stakeholders within this&nbsp;research&nbsp;to gain a comprehensive understanding of these insights&nbsp;before embarking on your web design project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Content first, design second</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p>Avoid designing&nbsp;content boxes across your website and trying to squeeze the content into these boxes.&nbsp;When designing a new website, it may seem&nbsp;counter&nbsp;intuitive&nbsp;to begin with a page of words&nbsp;rather than a&nbsp;design mock-up. But, it’s important to remember that Lorem Ipsum isn’t going to help anyone either.&nbsp;Begin with the content your users&nbsp;need&nbsp;and then design out from&nbsp;there.&nbsp;Capturing&nbsp;the content&nbsp;and its structure can be done in many ways;&nbsp;we like to build content models&nbsp;based on IA site maps and qualitative user testing such as card sorting&nbsp;and user journey mapping.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>By&nbsp;using a content-first&nbsp;design&nbsp;approach, you can&nbsp;understand what content needs to fit&nbsp;into your website&nbsp;design.&nbsp;Analysing your website’s content needs in the early stages or,&nbsp;even better, prior to the project beginning,&nbsp;can effectively&nbsp;inform and shape all touch points ultimately generating an optimised&nbsp;result&nbsp;with reduced time delays and constraints&nbsp;along the way.

Integral to the business, Ben uses his experience to code, build and support clients in creating outstanding website solutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Tell&nbsp;Us&nbsp;A&nbsp;Little&nbsp;Bit&nbsp;About&nbsp;You…</strong>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<p>This year, instead of having a&nbsp;New Year’s resolution, I&nbsp;decided I just wanted to try&nbsp;and&nbsp;be more&nbsp;creative.&nbsp;I really enjoy photography so I&nbsp;get out&nbsp;as much as I can&nbsp;and&nbsp;do mostly landscape&nbsp;or macro&nbsp;type&nbsp;photography,&nbsp;like plants and wildlife.&nbsp;I've been doing painting recently&nbsp;and&nbsp;I've got a 3D printer which I’ve been using more often.&nbsp;As my job role is very logical,&nbsp;I’ve been trying&nbsp;to step out of that and be more creative in my own time.&nbsp;This is probably a&nbsp;little&nbsp;stereotypical of developers, but&nbsp;I’m also into&nbsp;gaming.&nbsp;I always take part in the&nbsp;NetConstruct&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.netconstruct.com/insights/netconstruct-s-charity-gaming-marathon-is-nearly-here\">charity gaming event</a>&nbsp;and I play regularly at home too&nbsp;including&nbsp;board games and card games.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>What&nbsp;Is&nbsp;Your&nbsp;Background?&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<p>I’ve been at NetConstruct for four and a half years now and I’m sort of the odd one out in the development team…&nbsp;I joined NetConstruct, as a developer. Everyone else finished university and came through our Helpdesk, whereas I finished university back in 2012, had roughly a year off and then joined a software company where I built&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.netconstruct.com/umbraco-developer-umbraco-8-services-umbraco-cms-developer-netconstruct\">Umbraco websites</a>. I was there for two years and then wanted to move on, so I joined NetConstruct&nbsp;in a development position.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>My degree was in&nbsp;Computer Science with Games Development, I always wanted to work&nbsp;in IT since secondary school&nbsp;– it was either that or mathematics.&nbsp;Although my focus was initially&nbsp;to begin a career within&nbsp;game development, when I was in my last year of university, I learnt a bit about this&nbsp;industry&nbsp;and found that I wanted to&nbsp;go into&nbsp;straight development,&nbsp;so from there, I moved into websites and general systems.&nbsp;I’d&nbsp;still like to build a game at some point, but&nbsp;that’s&nbsp;just&nbsp;a dream&nbsp;at the moment!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>What&nbsp;Is&nbsp;Your&nbsp;Role&nbsp;In&nbsp;The&nbsp;Business?&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<p>I’m in development so my role involves&nbsp;coding and building&nbsp;websites. I take part in the technical workshops as well as&nbsp;client facing meetings and training too.&nbsp;Meeting clients&nbsp;gives you a chance to understand them and their business&nbsp;better,&nbsp;which obviously helps when I’m building their website and&nbsp;learning how I can work with them. If you can gauge their technical knowledge, you can also gauge what you need to do during development to make the CMS as enjoyable as possible for them to use. My role also encompasses providing support and guidance including technical opinions and expertise needed around projects, as well as&nbsp;showing the client how to use their new system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>What&nbsp;Value&nbsp;Do&nbsp;You, Or&nbsp;Your&nbsp;Team, Offer&nbsp;Clients?&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<p>My team&nbsp;offers a mixture of&nbsp;support, guidance&nbsp;and technical expertise. We often have clients come to us knowing they want a website which can do X, Y and Z,&nbsp;so we will take this spec and work out if it can be&nbsp;or&nbsp;should be done&nbsp;either from a technical standpoint or when considering&nbsp;general usability.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>We help clients&nbsp;reach&nbsp;the optimal&nbsp;path&nbsp;for them by suggesting ideas that will meet their objectives.&nbsp;If we see something is wrong, we say it, but we will always try to give a solution too. In development, it’s mostly looking at what we’ve done before, what we&nbsp;can&nbsp;use to help the client and sometimes looking at using a new piece of technology&nbsp;to&nbsp;help businesses evolve.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>What&nbsp;Do&nbsp;You&nbsp;Enjoy&nbsp;Most&nbsp;About&nbsp;Your&nbsp;Job?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<p>It’s the people.&nbsp;It’s a bit like a family atmosphere here.&nbsp;We&nbsp;take banter from each other…&nbsp;and give it back just as&nbsp;much,&nbsp;but we’re all friendly and we listen&nbsp;and value&nbsp;everyone’s&nbsp;opinions.&nbsp;It allows us to&nbsp;feel&nbsp;comfortable and more vocal, everyone is willing to collaborate and converse about a project.&nbsp;It’s important we&nbsp;encourage&nbsp;each team&nbsp;to have their say from their own expertise&nbsp;and experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>What&nbsp;Have&nbsp;You&nbsp;Found&nbsp;Challenging?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<p>Probably one of the most challenging parts of my role is when we inherit code from&nbsp;another agency.&nbsp;As we offer audits, we often&nbsp;takeover code from other companies. It’s a testament to our team that we can fix&nbsp;these&nbsp;issues that&nbsp;affect&nbsp;businesses.&nbsp;During this process, we sit&nbsp;with the client and use&nbsp;our problem-solving skills to fix their problems, advise&nbsp;them what to focus on, what they can improve&nbsp;and how they can do this.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For example, Serverlec Technologies was an Umbraco site we inherited, and the code base was a bit of a mess. We patched up as much as we could but, in the process, we built a great relationship with the client and ended up taking the site on for a full rebuild. It gave them the confidence that we could transform their site into what they needed and wanted.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>What&nbsp;Is Your Favourite Project You’ve Worked&nbsp;On&nbsp;And Why?&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<p>Probably Stericycle.&nbsp;This project was completed on <a href=\"https://www.netconstruct.com/kentico-developer-kentico-12-kentico-web-developer-gold-partner-netconstruct\">Kentico 12 MVC</a> which is a new platform and it was also multicultural which is the first time we had to do this for&nbsp;MVC. The site&nbsp;wasn’t&nbsp;that&nbsp;complicated,&nbsp;but the client was&nbsp;great&nbsp;and&nbsp;really easy&nbsp;to work with,&nbsp;every&nbsp;call&nbsp;we had with them&nbsp;was positive&nbsp;and&nbsp;all the training&nbsp;we implemented had great results.&nbsp;It was just an all-round&nbsp;positive&nbsp;project to be a part of!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>","comments":[{"guid":"648fd532-f714-47b8-8f5b-506c15e3c49a","commentReplies":[],"name":"Arron Foxley","date":"24/09/2023 22:28:27","emailAddress":"arronfoxley@hotmail.co.uk","message":"testing"},{"guid":"e6967248-573f-4c13-ac8e-20a763b751a3","commentReplies":[],"name":"Arron Foxley","date":"24/09/2023 12:46:14","emailAddress":"arronfoxley@hotmail.co.uk","message":"Testing comment"}]},{"id":3,"date":"2019-10-28T14:53:09.511Z","title":"Highlights from Kentico Connection Brno","image":"https://www.netconstruct.com/static/026bfc5011b0f64f2b912fd1d0ef87ae/f9a6c/brno.jpg","htmlContent":"<p>As a leading Kentico web development agency, we take enhancing our knowledge and staying on top when it comes to Kentico seriously. Regularly attending and often participating in their events around the globe, members of the NetConstruct team including MD, Jonathan and Developer, Liam, attended Kentico Connection on 18-19 September in Brno, Czech Republic. The insightful event was just the right mix of software news, Kentico culture and announcements for the future. Here are our top takeaways from the event.</p><h3>Commitment to Dual Product Strategy</h3>\r\n<p>With the rebranding of Kentico Cloud to Kentico Kontent taking place, there was a lot of discussion around their dual product strategy, defining this clearly to partners and end users. Confusion has been rife over Kentico’s CaaS (Content as a Service) product but Kentico Connection clarified their long-term commitment to the original EMS product. Clear positioning of both products means Kentico now has a distinct solution for the needs of any business who is serious about digital marketing. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Openness to Feedback</h3>\r\n<p>A hallmark of Kentico’s culture is their willingness to take on board feedback from customers, partners, developers and integrators. This was obvious during the event through the numerous conversations with both company executives and other key staff members who invited and discussed our opinion on a range of product and strategy related matters.</p>\r\n<h3>Increased Focus on Larger Projects</h3>\r\n<p>With continued endorsement from both&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en\">Gartner</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://go.forrester.com/\">Forrester</a>, Kentico EMS is now regarded by many as a true enterprise product. While Kentico initially positioned the EMS as a mid-market solution, there is no denying its use in a growing range of very large digital solutions. Kentico Cloud, is also being used across large-scale solutions, for example, a project for AC Milan Football Club to deliver a heavy throughput of content.</p>\r\n<h3>Kentico 2020</h3>\r\n<p>The release of their updated software is planned for September 2020 and the project has been given the official code name of Phoenix. Phoenix symbolises the rise from the ashes after burning away the remainder of Kentico webforms. The current Kentico MVC take up is approximately 40% of users with the software looking to push that figure closer towards 100% through the release of Kentico 2020 next year. The key improvements expected are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li><strong>Built in Automatic Dynamic Routing:</strong>&nbsp;Bespoke routing implementation will no longer be required. Kentico’s routing will instead work alongside custom routing, standalone, or completely disabled.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>Linked pages:</strong>&nbsp;This feature will allow for reusable content within the content tree.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>Support for .NET Core</strong>: Kentico libraries will be fully migrated to .NET Standard 2.0 once the release has launched. This will enable Kentico MVC projects to be built with the latest .NET Core release version 3.0.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Kentico Kontent</h3>\r\n<p>Further updates on Kentico Kontent were shared during the event with the new release of the Content Management API (CM API v2) coming soon. This version will bring more advanced support for publishing, unpublishing, workflows, content types, snippets, taxonomy and languages. CM API will no longer be for importing alone, it will also allow for integration and automation too.</p>\r\n<p>Webhook debugging tools have also been added to Kentico Kontent, allowing developers to debug webhook responses with ease. In addition, advanced configuration options have been implemented which will enable specific content types and workflow steps to trigger specific webhooks.</p>\r\n<h3>Kentico MVC Marketplace</h3>\r\n<p>During Kentico Connection, their MVC Marketplace was promoted regularly, encouraging partners and developers to submit work to help enhance the Kentico community. Something we’re keen to be part of, NetConstruct developer Liam submitted an MVC form component prior to Kentico Connection which can be viewed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/liamgold/font-awesome-form-component\">here</a>.</p>\r\n<p>A growing list of custom elements have been added to GitHub, a marketplace for developers to share new functionality and integrations. A number of example eCommerce integrations for Kentico Kontent are now readily available on GitHub which can be added to existing and new Kentico Kontent builds.</p>\r\n<p>Jonathan and Liam were unanimous in their opinions that Kentico Connection brilliant and informative across all bases. A big thank you to Kentico for hosting us and delivering yet another intriguing Kentico Connection, sharing further insight into their future plans and advancements. We’re already looking forward to the next one! #KenticoConnection2019</p>","comments":[{"guid":"7a7a062f-003c-4336-9c64-a15aa286a403","commentReplies":[],"name":"Arron Foxley","date":"24/09/2023 22:26:56","emailAddress":"arronfoxley@hotmail.co.uk","message":"test"},{"guid":"a9294989-1f9d-4dc5-bfe4-b66250daabba","commentReplies":[],"name":"Arron Foxley","date":"24/09/2023 22:28:39","emailAddress":"arronfoxley@hotmail.co.uk","message":"testing"}]}]}
